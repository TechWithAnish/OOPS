# C++ OOP Concepts

This repository contains example codes demonstrating various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++. Each file corresponds to a specific OOP concept.

## Files

1. **abstract_class.cpp**: Demonstrates abstract classes and pure virtual functions.
2. **abstraction.cpp**: Demonstrates abstraction using abstract classes.
3. **class_object.cpp**: Demonstrates basic class and object creation.
4. **encapsulation.cpp**: Demonstrates encapsulation by restricting direct access to data members.
5. **inheritance.cpp**: Demonstrates inheritance and the use of base and derived classes.
6. **method_overloading.cpp**: Demonstrates method overloading within a class.
7. **method_overriding.cpp**: Demonstrates method overriding using virtual functions.
8. **operator_overloading.cpp**: Demonstrates operator overloading for custom types.
9. **polymorphism.cpp**: Demonstrates polymorphism through base class pointers and virtual functions.

## Getting Started

To run any of these examples, you need a C++ compiler. You can compile and run each file using the following commands:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
